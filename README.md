The movies shown are related with the current localisation of the mobile phone.
Each movie has a detail screen with the resume of the film. 

Technologies or libraries used:

-> Retrofit for accessing to rest endpoints
-> Adapter pattern to fill the recycler view with de fetched data
-> Glide to convert url strings to image resources.
